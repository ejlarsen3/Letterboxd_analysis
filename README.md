# Letterboxd_analysis

#### Project Status: Finished

## Description
I used selenium and beautifulsoup to parse Letterboxd, a movie-reviewing website, and scrape data from the most popular movies page. After running a python script, I was able to collect data on just over 1900 different movies. This project aims to identify both trends within and aspects of the top movies on the site.

## Methods and Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Webscraping:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Numpy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib

## Results
* New Insights, on aspects such as trends like those between average rating and number of likes, or how the average rating has declined over time
* The genre-theme combination insights could easily be utilized to optimize a recommendation system
